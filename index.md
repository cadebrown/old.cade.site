# About Me - Cade Brown

Hey! My name is Cade Brown and I'm a software developer, mathematician, and researcher. Outside of my work and studies, I have personal interests in [digital art](/art), [music production](/music), and [philosophy](/phil). 

Currently, I'm studying at [UTK](https://utk.edu) for a bachelors in Computer Science, while working as a Research Assistant at the [Innovative Computing Laboratory (ICL)](https://icl.utk.edu), and a Research Intern at [NVIDIA](https://nvidia.com). My main areas of interest are [Machine Learning (ML)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning), [High Performance Computing (HPC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-performance_computing), and [Programming Language Theory (PLT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language_theory).

I'm always looking for new connections, so if you have any comments or inquiries, reach out! My email is: [me@cade.site](mailto:me@cade.site)
