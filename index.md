# Hey! I'm Cade Brown

I'm a programmer, researcher, and artist based in Knoxville, TN, USA. Currently, I'm studying at [UTK](https://utk.edu) for a Computer Science degree, while working at [ICL](https://icl.utk.edu) as a research assistant. Previously, I've worked at [NVIDIA](https://nvidia.com), [ORNL](https://ornl.gov), and [PAIRS @ UTK](https://pairs.eecs.utk.edu/).

My main interests are Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (ML/AI), High-Performance Computing (HPC), and Programming Language Theory (PLT). On this site:

* [/blog](/blog): research, artwork, and other things I've worked on
* [/links](/links): useful apps, sites, and info found on the web
* [/art](/art): my artwork, including ML/AI-generated and data art

Also, here's [my resume](/resume-CadeBrown.pdf), [my CV](/cv-CadeBrown.pdf), and [my Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cade-brown/).

My email is [me@cade.site](mailto:me@cade.site); please send any questions or ideas!
