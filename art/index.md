# My Artwork

Our society is becoming increasingly digitized, and our technology is progressing at an ever increasing rate. My art explores the autocomplexification of society through the lens of compute and data based artistic techniques. 



Just scroll through this page for an overview of all my artwork, or check specific project's I've worked on:

  * [SDV: Stable Diffusion Visions](/sdv), a series of AI-generated images assigned to integers
  * [Downloadable HD Poster Designs](/sd-posters) (via Stable Diffusion)
  * [Downloadable HD Phone Wallpapers](/sd-phone) (via Stable Diffusion)



For example, most of my art is generated using [Machine Learning (ML)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) and [Artificial Intelligence (AI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence), utilizing various technologies:

  * [Stable Diffusion, an open source diffusion model](https://stability.ai/blog/stable-diffusion-public-release)
  * [DALL-E 2, a API-restricted diffusion model](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/)
  * [Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network)


## Images

These are mainly generated with [DALL-E 2](/dalle2) or [Stable Diffusion](https://stability.ai/blog/stable-diffusion-public-release), which are AI art techniques for turning a textual description into a realistic image. Some of the fractals are generated by [programs I've written](https://simplesummit.github.io/blog/fractalexplorer) which are not based on machine learning methods.

## Animations

Combining multiple methods (i.e. through [pytti](https://pytti-tools.github.io/pytti-book/intro.html)) allows us to make coherent animations and videos using AI image generation, AI interpolation, and AI upscaling. My favorite personal stack is:

  * [VQGAN](https://compvis.github.io/taming-transformers/)+[CLIP](https://openai.com/blog/clip/) for image generation
  * [RIFE](https://github.com/megvii-research/ECCV2022-RIFE)/[FLAVR](https://tarun005.github.io/FLAVR/) for increasing framerates and smoothing video
  * [SRCNN](https://github.com/kunal-visoulia/Image-Restoration-using-SRCNN) for upscaling to higher quality
