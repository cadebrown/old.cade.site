I'm [Cade Brown](https://cade.site), and this page is a portfolio of my personal artwork! I try to focus on the intersection of math, programming, and aesthetics, and explore machine-generated and data-oriented art. I'm interested in demonstrating how machine understanding can be utilized to create art that is both visually striking and meaningful to humans, using a variety of techniques (latent representations, diffusion, GANs, mathematical modelling).

Our society is becoming increasingly digitized, and our technology is progressing at an ever increasing rate; so much so that there is a notable lack of artistic commentary on technology itself (most art deals with historical ideas, which are more or less fixed with respect to a generation of people). My artwork attempts to remedy this by showcasing the state of the art in artificial intelligence and digital artwork. Enjoy!

## Art Projects

It's hard to organize and categorize some of my artwork, but here are some general projects I've been working on:

  * [Beautiful HD Phone Wallpapers](/sd-phone) for download
  * [HD 24x36 inch Posters](/ai-posters-24x36) for download
  * [All Stable Diffusion images](/art/all-stable-diffusion) I've generated

## Images

These are mainly generated with [DALL-E 2](/dalle2) or [Stable Diffusion](https://stability.ai/blog/stable-diffusion-public-release), which are AI art techniques for turning a textual description into a realistic image. Some of the fractals are generated by [programs I've written](https://simplesummit.github.io/blog/fractalexplorer) which are not based on machine learning methods.

## Animations

Combining multiple methods (i.e. through [pytti](https://pytti-tools.github.io/pytti-book/intro.html)) allows us to make coherent animations and videos using AI image generation, AI interpolation, and AI upscaling. My favorite personal stack is:

  * [VQGAN](https://compvis.github.io/taming-transformers/)+[CLIP](https://openai.com/blog/clip/) for image generation
  * [RIFE](https://github.com/megvii-research/ECCV2022-RIFE)/[FLAVR](https://tarun005.github.io/FLAVR/) for increasing framerates and smoothing video
  * [SRCNN](https://github.com/kunal-visoulia/Image-Restoration-using-SRCNN) for upscaling to higher quality
