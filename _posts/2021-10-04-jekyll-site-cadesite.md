Recently, i've been cleaning house on old projects and websites -- and i realized i wanted to get this blog going as a technical blog. What better way than by making a blog post about the blog itself? The full source code for my website is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/cadebrown/cadebrown.github.io), and hosted at [cade.site](https://cade.site)

## Setup/Customization

The guide for actually setting this up is located [in the readme on GitHub](https://github.com/cadebrown/cadebrown.github.io#readme). This blog post just covers some of the features

You can also check `_config.yml`, it includes comments describing most of the settings.

## Goal

The goal of this project is to have a clean, fast, and easy-to-modify blog that other people can use for theirs. this jekyll template has:

  * math formatting using [KaTeX](https://www.katex.org/) (i.e. `$...$` and `$$...$$`)
  * code syntax highlighting using [Prism](https://prismjs.com/)
  * [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) for comments
  * and more... (see the readme on GitHub)


## Themes

I include 3 themes by default:


### chalkboard

`chalkboard` is my default theme, which is a dark theme with a modern, solarized look:

### whiteboard

`whiteboard` is basically the light version of chalkboard, and might be the default for most people (that think light themes are tolerable)

### 1337

`1337` (leet) shows how versatile you can make the themes, including tiling image backgrounds, and a terminal-esque experience
