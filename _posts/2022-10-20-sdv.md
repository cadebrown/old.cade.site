SDV (Stable Diffusion Visions) is an art project that seeks to document a chain of AI-generated graphics that are loosely connected. Each vision has a unique ID (an integer, starting at `0`) and a title, and will be printed out once.

These aren't NFTs -- just a fun project, and things I will be printing out in physical mediums as 1/1 prints. You can find the full gallery on this page, and clicking on an image will bring you to that dedicated page, where you can leave comments (TODO) on the image and download the full resolution version:

<!--
$ python3 -c 'print(";".join([f"sdv-{i}.webp" for i in range(38)]))'
$ python3 -c 'print(";".join([f"/sdv/{i}" for i in range(38)]))'
-->

Or, click this button to go to a random one: <button onclick="window.location='/sdv/' + Math.floor(Math.random() * 38);" value="click here">See Random Vision</button>
