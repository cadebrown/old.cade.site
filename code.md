This page contains links to programming projects that you can use or read about:

[MAGMA @ ICL](https://icl.utk.edu/magma/): Matrix Algebra on GPU and Multicore Architectures

: I was a student researcher working on MAGMA, a library for dense linear algebra on GPUs and multicore CPUs

: Check out the paper I wrote about it: [cade.site/paper0](cade.site/paper0) (co-authored with Jack Dongarra, Turing Award winner)

[carve.cade.site](https://carve.cade.site): an online RISC-V web IDE and emulator

: Written by Cade Brown and Gregory Croisdale, using C/C++, HTML/CSS/JS, WebAssembly, and RISC-V

[kscript.org](https://kscript.org): a dynamic scripting language for the web

: Runs in your browser, check it out! [term.kscript.org](https://term.kscript.org)

: Written by Cade Brown, using C/C++, HTML/CSS/JS, WebAssembly, LLVM, GMP, FFTW

[fractalexplorer](https://simplesummit.github.io/blog/fractalexplorer): a realtime distributed fractal explorer

: Written as part of my internship at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, which aimed to demonstrate how GPUs and multiple compute nodes can be used to render fractals in realtime

: Written by Cade Brown, using C/C++, CUDA, SDL, MPI

: Check out the video demo, here; [cade.site/fractalvideo](https://cade.site/fractalvideo)

[Blok](https://github.com/cadebrown/blok): a 3D minecraft-style game from scratch

: I wrote this to learn the theory of random terrain generation, voxel rendering, and computer graphics

: Written by Cade Brown, using C/C++, GLFW, OpenGL

[mycc](https://github.com/cadebrown/mycc): a C compiler using LLVM

: Compiles a subset of C and generates code using LLVM, including a few examples on the github

: Written by Cade Brown, using C/C++, LLVM
